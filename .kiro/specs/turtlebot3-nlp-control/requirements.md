# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a natural language processing system to control TurtleBot3 robot in Gazebo simulation environment using Gemini API. The system will allow users to give voice or text commands in natural language (Japanese/English) to control the robot's movement and actions within the simulated environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want to set up a ROS2 Humble environment with TurtleBot3 and Gazebo in Docker, so that I can have a consistent and reproducible simulation environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker container is started THEN the system SHALL provide Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment
2. WHEN the container is initialized THEN ROS2 Humble SHALL be properly installed and configured
3. WHEN the container runs THEN Python 3.10.6 SHALL be available for development
4. WHEN TurtleBot3 packages are installed THEN Gazebo simulation SHALL be able to launch TurtleBot3 models
5. IF the container is restarted THEN all ROS2 and TurtleBot3 configurations SHALL persist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to launch TurtleBot3 in Gazebo simulation, so that I can have a virtual robot to control with natural language commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the launch command is executed THEN Gazebo SHALL start with TurtleBot3 model loaded
2. WHEN Gazebo is running THEN the TurtleBot3 robot SHALL be visible and responsive in the simulation
3. WHEN the simulation starts THEN all necessary ROS2 nodes for TurtleBot3 control SHALL be active
4. IF Gazebo crashes THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to integrate Gemini API for natural language processing, so that I can send voice or text commands to control the robot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a natural language command is received THEN the system SHALL send it to Gemini API for processing
2. WHEN Gemini API responds THEN the system SHALL parse the response into robot control commands
3. WHEN API key is provided THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully with Gemini API
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide feedback
5. WHEN processing Japanese or English commands THEN the system SHALL correctly interpret movement instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to give natural language movement commands, so that I can control TurtleBot3's movement without knowing ROS2 command syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say "move forward" THEN the robot SHALL move forward at appropriate speed
2. WHEN I say "turn left" or "turn right" THEN the robot SHALL rotate in the specified direction
3. WHEN I say "stop" THEN the robot SHALL immediately cease all movement
4. WHEN I give speed instructions like "move slowly" THEN the robot SHALL adjust its velocity accordingly
5. WHEN I give distance/time instructions THEN the robot SHALL move for the specified duration or distance
6. IF an invalid command is given THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about available commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to publish appropriate ROS2 messages, so that TurtleBot3 can execute the interpreted commands from natural language input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a movement command is interpreted THEN the system SHALL publish geometry_msgs/Twist messages to /cmd_vel topic
2. WHEN linear movement is requested THEN linear.x velocity SHALL be set appropriately
3. WHEN rotational movement is requested THEN angular.z velocity SHALL be set appropriately
4. WHEN stop command is given THEN all velocity values SHALL be set to zero
5. IF command execution completes THEN the system SHALL be ready for the next command

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice input capability, so that I can control the robot hands-free using speech commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is activated THEN the system SHALL capture audio from microphone
2. WHEN speech is detected THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text
3. WHEN text conversion is complete THEN the converted text SHALL be sent to Gemini API for command interpretation
4. IF voice recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and allow retry
5. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL filter and focus on voice commands

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN request/response details SHALL be logged for debugging
3. WHEN robot commands are executed THEN command details SHALL be logged
4. IF system encounters unexpected errors THEN graceful degradation SHALL occur
5. WHEN system starts THEN initialization status SHALL be clearly reported
